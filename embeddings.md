## Evaluation
To evaluate the quality ofembeddings, we selected a control set of 100 genes from the lens enriched and other well known gene families. These included Crystallins, Actins, Notch (signalling pathways), Dynenin, Kinesin (RTK, motor proteins), Ephrin , EGF receptor genes (signal transducing proteins), Argonautes (AGO), ABC transporters (transporters), and other families (Fibroblast growth factors).The CDS seqeunces were downaloaded from [BioMart](http://www.ensembl.org/biomart/martview/).
